# Ahmed-Data-Analyst-Portfolio

As a Data Analyst in Harwood Acoustics, I employ my skills, experiences, and technical expertise to achieve outcomes for the Company. I am deeply passionate about the data analysis work I am currently engaged in because it allows me to uncover meaningful insights, identify patterns, and contribute to informed decision-making, fostering my enthusiasm for transforming raw data into valuable knowledge. I am confident that I can add significant value as a Data Analyst. 

The previous and current projects by employing the data analysis and visulizing tools e.g., SQL, Power BI, Python, Matlab, and excel, are listed below

## Development of a Dynamic PowerBI Dashboard for Real-Time KPI Tracking 

I led a Power BI project for a global cycling equipment manufacturing company, aiming to develop a dynamic dashboard to track their KPIs: sales, revenue, and profit. The client sought to gain actionable insights with time into their sales performance across diverse markets and product lines. The objective was to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that could aggregate, visualize, and analyse sales data to identify key trends, patterns, and performance indicators with real-time.

I began by gathering data from various sources, including sales databases, CRM systems, and financial records. The sample of uncleaned raw data is shown in the following link with name "Sample of Sales in 2020-2022"

The tables pen in the RHS of the Sample of Sales in 2020-2022 dashboard, are indicating various product information, return information, Customers information, and region information. These raw data is then cleaned, transformed, and modelled the data to ensure accuracy and relevance. The data set has been modelled using the STAR Schema, see the data modelling ground work link

Using Power BI's advanced analytics and visualization features, I created interactive dashboards and reports, incorporating slicers, filters, and dynamic visuals to provide a user-friendly experience. I then implemented measures to track sales, revenue, and profit metrics, enabling real-time monitoring and benchmarking against targets. The Power BI solution empowered the client to make data-driven decisions, optimize sales strategies, and enhance overall performance. With clear insights into KPIs, the company achieved improved 
profitability, streamlined operations, and gained a competitive edge in the global market. Using DAX with M code, the sample of few analysis are given as below.

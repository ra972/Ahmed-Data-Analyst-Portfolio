## POWER BI PROJECT TITLE: Development of a Dynamic and Interactive PowerBI Dashboard for Real-Time Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Tracking 

I led a Power BI project for a global cycling equipment manufacturing company, aiming to develop a dynamic and interactive dashboard to track the company KPIs(sales, revenue, and profit), geospatial analysis, and product level analysis. The client sought to gain actionable insights with time into their sales performance across diverse markets and product lines. The objective was to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that could aggregate, visualize, and analyse sales data to identify key trends, patterns, and performance indicators with real-time.

I began by gathering data from various sources, including sales databases, CRM systems, and financial records. The sample of uncleaned raw data is shown in the following link [Sample of Sales in 2020-2022](Raw-data.jpeg). 
The tables pen in the RHS of the Sample of Sales in 2020-2022 dashboard, are indicating various product information, return information, customers information, and region information. These raw data is then cleaned, transformed, and modelled the data to ensure accuracy and relevance, see the link [Samples of Sales Data Cleaning](Sample-of-Data-Cleaning_Sales.jpeg). The data set has been modelled using the STAR Schema, see the data modelling ground work link

Using Power BI's advanced analytics and visualization features, I created interactive dashboards and reports, incorporating slicers, filters, and dynamic visuals to provide a user-friendly experience. I then implemented measures to track sales, revenue, and profit metrics, enabling real-time monitoring and benchmarking against targets. The Power BI solution empowered the client to make data-driven decisions, optimize sales strategies, and enhance overall performance. With clear insights into KPIs, the company achieved improved 
profitability, streamlined operations, and gained a competitive edge in the global market. Using DAX with M code, the sample of few analysis are given as below.

## TABLEAU PROJECT TITLE: Sales Analysis with Tableau
-[Dashboard of Sales Analysis](Tablaudash.jpeg)

Project Overview:
This project showcases a sales analysis dashboard built using Tableau. The analysis focuses on the total sales performance of various sales representatives across different regions. The purpose of this project is to provide insights into the sales distribution by region and by representative, helping stakeholders identify top performers and areas that may need improvement.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the total sales figures across different regions and sales representatives. This analysis aims to:
-Visualize the total sales by region and representative.
-Identify top-performing representatives in each region.
-Highlight regions or representatives with lower sales figures for potential performance improvement.
-Provide a comprehensive view of sales distribution across the company.

Data:
The data used in this project includes:
-Item: The product being sold.
-Order Date: The date when the order was placed.
-Region: The geographical area where the sales were made (Central, East, West).
-Rep: The sales representative responsible for the sales.
-Total Sales: The total sales amount for each transaction.
-Unit Price: The price per unit of the product sold.
-Units: The number of units sold.

Dashboard Features:
-The Tableau dashboard consists of the following key features:
-Bar Chart Visualization: A bar chart representing total sales by sales representative, segmented by region. This visualization helps in identifying the top sales reps in each region.
-Color Coding: Different colors are used to represent different sales representatives for easy identification.
-Interactive Filters: The dashboard allows users to filter data by specific regions or representatives, making it easier to focus on particular segments.

Insights From the Analysis:
-The East region shows the highest sales performance, with Susan being the top sales representative.
-The Central region also shows strong performance, particularly by Matthew.
-Some regions have sales representatives with lower sales figures, indicating areas where performance improvement strategies may be needed.

Conclusion:
This Tableau dashboard effectively visualizes the distribution of sales across regions and representatives, providing valuable insights for decision-makers. The interactive nature of the dashboard allows users to explore the data in various ways, leading to more informed business strategies.

## TABLEAU PROJECT TITLE: Visualizing USA Unemployment Trends by Age Group

Project Description:
This Tableau project visualizes the trends in unemployment across different age groups in the USA, highlighting how various demographic segments were impacted over time. The visualization, presented as a stacked area chart, breaks down the total number of unemployed individuals into age groups such as "20 to 24 years", "25 to 34 years", "35 to 44 years", "45 to 54 years", "55 to 64 years", and "65 years and over".
The data reveals significant fluctuations in unemployment, particularly around major economic events, with younger age groups experiencing more volatility. The chart effectively shows the cumulative impact of unemployment across age demographics, allowing for easy comparison and historical analysis.
This project provides valuable insights for policymakers, economists, and researchers, offering a clear visual representation of how unemployment has evolved across different age categories in the USA. The visualization can be used to inform decisions regarding economic policies and workforce development strategies.

## SQL PROJECT TITLE: Clean and Filter Movie the Data 

I have been given a set of uncleaned movies data ([Movie_data](1.jpeg)) to clean and filter. The data has been then cleaned and filtered acording to the type of movie ([filtered action movie](2.jpeg)) release date, and revenue ([filtered Comedy movies which sequered revenue above 300000000](3.jpeg)). The cleaned data was then used to visulize based on the genere ,i.e.,drama, action, and comedy ([Sample of Movie Bar Chart Based on Genre and Gender](Screenshot-2024-06-06-at-12.42.23-pm.jpeg)).

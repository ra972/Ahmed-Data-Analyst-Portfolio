# Ahmed-Data-Analyst-Portfolio

As a Data Analyst in Harwood Acoustics, I employ my skills, experiences, and technical expertise to achieve outcomes for the Company. I am deeply passionate about the data analysis work I am currently engaged in because it allows me to uncover meaningful insights, identify patterns, and contribute to informed decision-making, fostering my enthusiasm for transforming raw data into valuable knowledge. I am confident that I can add significant value as a Data Analyst. 

The previous and current projects by employing the data analysis and visulizing tools e.g., SQL, Power BI, Python, Matlab, and excel, are listed below

In my current role, I have gained a good understanding of compliance with legislation, policies, and standards, including code of conduct, health and safety policies, and procedures. Recently, my supervisor assigned me a job to find a solution to keep the noise level optimum inside a big construction site. To understand the task, first I extracted data from the SQL and spreadsheet servers, then cleaned the data using SQL query (see attachment 1). I then analysed the data through R and MATLAB programming language This enabled me to predict a suitable optimum solution for project. I then prepared a report, save all the script and analysis in shared drive, and presented report to my supervisor with analysis results and my recommendations on the project. My supervisor was very happy with the pathway optimum solution analysis results. I arranged a meeting with internal and external stakeholders, where I presented the technical information in a simple way so that it suits audiences including non-technical personal and addressed stakeholder questions. As a result, the stakeholders agreed to my recommendations, and it was then implemented.

I have gained effective problem-solving skill and identify data anomalies in summaries and reports. About 1 year ago at UOW, my project supervisor assigned me an external data request job for a particular issue (steel making material indexes). To accomplish this task, I wrote code for the requirement to extract data from SQL, then cleaned data using Power BI and found that around 700 entries had unphysical (Na, empty, 0, etc) entries. To do so I faced different data barriers, but I did overcome those problem as I have very high attention to detail. Then I prepared a data summary and report to my supervisor using an excel spreadsheet and visualised data through Power BI. Afterward, I presented the data summary and report to our external client within the time frame, who expressed satisfaction with the presentation. This experience demonstrates my ability to evaluate the accuracy of script outputs, high attention to detail in working with data and reveal effective problem-solving skills.
I led a Power BI project for a global cycling equipment manufacturing company, aiming to develop a dynamic dashboard to track their KPIs: sales, revenue, and profit. The client sought to gain actionable insights with time into their sales performance across diverse markets and product lines. The objective was to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that could aggregate, visualize, and analyse sales data to identify key trends, patterns, and performance indicators. I began by gathering data from various sources, including sales databases, CRM systems, and financial records. I then cleaned, transformed, and modelled the data to ensure accuracy and relevance. Using Power BI's advanced analytics and visualization features, I created interactive dashboards and reports, incorporating slicers, filters, and dynamic visuals to provide a user-friendly experience. I then implemented measures to track sales, revenue, and profit metrics, enabling real-time monitoring and benchmarking against targets. The Power BI solution empowered the client to make data-driven decisions, optimize sales strategies, and enhance overall performance. With clear insights into KPIs, the company achieved improved 
profitability, streamlined operations, and gained a competitive edge in the global market. The data modelling and relational data base tables has been shown below attached by the screenshot 2.
I have demonstrated my ability to work effectively in a team environment, and to build and sustain collaborative relationships with internal and external stakeholder. I can interpret complex data sets patterns and trends to organise the information more meaningfully. I am dedicated to continuous improvement, actively seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and qualifications to excel in my role.
Given the opportunity, I am confident that I can become a valuable member of your team. If your ideal candidate is focused and decisive, organised, and reliable, experienced, and expert, I hope you will consider my application. I extend my thanks for your time and consideration, and I look forward to sharing my perspectives at your organisation and arranging a meeting at your earliest convenience.
